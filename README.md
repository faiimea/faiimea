About my name in github:
Let's see the last part of it:mea,who was(maybe ... still is) my idol.She is quite different that I couldn't stop chasing her trial.
While there happened tons of things,and my love has been dull.However ,she is now existed as a sign of my memory,and the ones I love.
About the first part...
You know the word:fall and fail
yeah,I mean 
faii is always next to fail,near to fall,but 
you know 
He came within a whisker of failure.

About myself:
I am a fresh student of the Shanghai Jiaotong University(SJTU)

Because of the terrible performance in the divergence test,and therefore I chose the Information Security as my major(Because my favourite major is SE).
Now I devote myself to strgguling with the challenge in zhiyuan college.
It is really a hard time ,but I believe I will overcome it
It is always my dream to be a computer engineer.
