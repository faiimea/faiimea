"The Brain is Wider Than the Sky."

Hi,here is faiimea's page.

About my name in github:
mea,who was(maybe ... still is) my idol.She is quite different that I couldn't stop chasing her trial.
While there happened tons of trouble things,and my love has been kind of dull.However ,she is now existed as a unbeatable sign of my past memory,and the ones I love.
about faii.
You know the word:fail,fail is normal,and everyone has to face the failure.
yeah,I mean 
faii is always next to fail,ready to fail,but 
you know 
He came within a whisker of failure.

About myself:
I am a fresh student of the Shanghai Jiaotong University(SJTU)
Because of the terrible performance in the divergence test,and therefore I chose the Information Security as my major
Now I devote myself to strgguling with the challenge in zhiyuan college.
It is really a hard time ,but I believe I will overcome it(or find a better way to seek for my dream)

else:
Philosophy: I attempt to find the meaning of life.I think sometimes that agnosticism can lead to a moral maturity. 
Literature: Haruki murakami's works really change my life and shape my soul.
Artificial Intelligence: The future belongs to AI. As long as I can make some contribution to artificial intelligence in my life, I will die in peace
ACG culture: vitural to live/
Society: Being a member of the community, I am glad to devote myself to a compaign (revolution/upadte) to reduce the pain and unfairness.
